            Hi, I'm Greg Barker, a Full-Stack Developer. I have a passion for
            coding and creating responsive web applications. I enjoy working
            with React, Node.js, and Express.js. I am always looking to learn
            new technologies and improve my skills. I am a team player and work
            well with others. I am a quick learner and can adapt to new
            situations. I am also a problem solver and can troubleshoot issues
            quickly. I am always looking for new opportunities to grow and
            expand my knowledge.
